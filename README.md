# FirstFlutterApp
  ### This is my first app using flutter. 
  
## What I used
  ### 
      OS: Windows 10
      Software: Android Studio with flutter and dart Plugin
      
## Reason to create
  ###
      I decide to create this app just for put in practice the first things I've been know about flutter.
      
## What I learned
  ###    
      I learn the concepts about widgets, hierarchy and I learn how to put all the widgets together with Scaffold.

## What the app do
 ###
      The app split the bill for the number of the people.
      Example: Bill: R$100
               People:10
       So each person will pay 10 bucks.
